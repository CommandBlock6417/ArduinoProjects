# Time-Bomb

this is a bomb ( that detonates only acoustically and is very nervewracking) 
 *     that I made on the 19-23/11/2019, when I was twelve years old.
 *     It is not that useful but I think it's pretty cool.
 *     Here is how it works:
 *         you can select the value of the bomb in seconds on the b_setup tab
 *         when the Arduino is plugged in, the countdown starts immediately.
 *         Once the countdown finishes, the "bomb" emits a very annoying sound that will wrack anyone's nerves.
 * NOTE: This NOT a weapon of mass destruction. 
 *       It is only used for mental destruction, if one wants to mess with another's nerves.
